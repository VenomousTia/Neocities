Where a header or a footer have specific purposes, div is defined by the purpose YOU give it. This purpose CAN be as a header or a footer, as shown in the code. You give it purpose by assigning it a 'class', like an RPG! -->
    <!-- Why use <div> instead of designated blocks like <header> or <footer>? Because of the ease in styling them in the CSS sheet using GRIDS!! It's a lot easier to edit the class than the entire block itself. We'll go into grids in the CSS sheet. -->

          <p>29-10-2025:<br>I've managed to add the 'Deploy to Neocities' action to the github repository for this site, but in the process I broke all my images by accidentally deleting them. I'm slowly getting as many of them back up as I can but for now the site is just wonky.</p>
          <p>17-09-2025:<br>Will link <a href="https://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book">Rob Miles' book on learning c#</a>, when my media page is redone. Also gotta redo the scrolling section for updates so this page doesn't get unnecessarily long.</p><br>
          <p>16-09-2025:<br>Gotta figure out about getting webamp on here as a an updated version of the wikplayer from the old site version.</p><br>
          <p>14-08-2025:<br>The gamelog page has been kicking my ass so much that I haven't put time into other parts of the webpage. It's resulted in me just putting it on an indefinite hold/hiatus which is just hhhhh. I think I'm going to wait with the gamelog, maybe reduce it to something way simpler than my OG plans, and instead focus on other parts of the site. I am getting back into doing pixel art so I'll likely make a page for that.</p>
        </div>
          <p>Yo, I don't have anything special here rn bc i'm still working on the other pages. Similar to the old setup tbh, but just better code now (imo). I'll be making a page entirely dedicated to vidyagaymes instead of shrines bc that's more relevant to me tbh. I will probably still make something related to durgetash though, because that's never going to die within me.</p><br>
