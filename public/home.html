  <!-- <div>, short for division, is a catch-all block that is used to style the different divisions/sections of your webpage. Div is a HUGE part of the visual aspect. Where a header or a footer have specific purposes, div is defined by the purpose YOU give it. This purpose CAN be as a header or a footer, as shown in the code. You give it purpose by assigning it a 'class', like an RPG! -->
    <!-- Why use <div> instead of designated blocks like <header> or <footer>? Because of the ease in styling them in the CSS sheet using GRIDS!! It's a lot easier to edit the class than the entire block itself. We'll go into grids in the CSS sheet. -->

        <h1>BOO! Scares you with my autism</h1>
        <div class="updates">
          <p>05-01-2025:<br> Quick added the increment button on home-page. Music player will have to wait, as I will have to figure out a way to incorporate scmplayer's url-link feature into it, instead of referring to .mp3 files.</p>
          <p>26-11-2025:<br>Added <a href="https://july.lol/musicplayer">july.lol's music player</a> to home page. Will have to add it everywhere else as well, perhaps by looking at how <a href="https://github.com/cshum/scm-music-player">scmplayer</a> (which I've used before) does it. NOTE: scmplayer's website no longer functions, but the code is still available on github.</p>
          <p>06-11-2025:<br>Attempting to make script for a pagedoll that changes on every page refresh. Additionally, scrapping current header to turn it into the button scroll from the old site. This is due to adding NavLinks, which lengthened the main content area. (Though I could alternatively make a second aside on the right for it and other things (like the pagedoll))</p>
          <p>31-10-2025:<br>Successfully got github (specifically .gitnignore) to not upload images to the repo. This is to avoid having art and especially commissions just fully public (yes ppl can still just download them from this site but it's the principle of it all) ― by sheer luck, I had all my old images on a local folder, so I've reaquired them. Now I simply need to reincorporate them into the new site</p>
          <p>29-10-2025:<br>I've managed to add the 'Deploy to Neocities' action to the github repository for this site, but in the process I broke all my images by accidentally deleting them. I'm slowly getting as many of them back up as I can but for now the site is just wonky.</p>
          <p>17-09-2025:<br>Will link <a href="https://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book">Rob Miles' book on learning c#</a>, when my media page is redone. Also gotta redo the scrolling section for updates so this page doesn't get unnecessarily long.</p><br>
          <p>16-09-2025:<br>Gotta figure out about getting webamp on here as a an updated version of the wikplayer from the old site version.</p><br>
          <p>14-08-2025:<br>The gamelog page has been kicking my ass so much that I haven't put time into other parts of the webpage. It's resulted in me just putting it on an indefinite hold/hiatus which is just hhhhh. I think I'm going to wait with the gamelog, maybe reduce it to something way simpler than my OG plans, and instead focus on other parts of the site. I am getting back into doing pixel art so I'll likely make a page for that.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Yo, I don't have anything special here rn bc i'm still working on the other pages. Similar to the old setup tbh, but just better code now (imo). I'll be making a page entirely dedicated to vidyagaymes instead of shrines bc that's more relevant to me tbh. I will probably still make something related to durgetash though, because that's never going to die within me.</p><br>
